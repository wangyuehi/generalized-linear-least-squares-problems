COMP 642 final project

### Comparison of three methods for computing the GLS estimator.
* Method 1 was presented in COMP 642 lecture notes, called Paige's approach.
* Method 2 was presented in "C.C. Paige. Fast numerically stable computations for generalized linear least squares problems. SIAM J. Num. Anal., 16:165-171, 1979"
* Method 3 was a modification based on method 1, but it applied Householder transformations to Σ to get Σ ̄ = QT ΣQ. Then compute the “partial” reverse Cholesky factorization
